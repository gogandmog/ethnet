# EtherNet Transaction Tools

EtherNet TX Tools is a set of tools based to work various functions in the Ethereum Network.

With EtherNet TX Tools, you can generate valid Ethereum transactions such as Ether/Token transfer transactions (including support for over 80 of the top Ethereum based Tokens) and and Contract transactions by bruteforcing valid hashes/checksums.

EtherNet Transaction Tools is a project not only for developers, programmers, and those who want to experiment with custom Ethereum Transactions, but also a tool for those who simply want to learn how the Ethereum network works.

EtherNet TX Tools allow you to generate and broadcast valid checksum transactions to the Ethereum Network (Testnet/Mainnet).

Note: The transactions broadcasted are not made with "real" keys, and therefore will never receive confirmations on the Ethereum network. Instead, they will stay in a "pending" or "unconfirmed" state on the block explorers, wallets, Geth, Mist, and Etc. until the website/client "decides" that the transaction will never confirm, and thus will either reject or remove the transaction from the cients' history.

### Generating "Fake" transactions by brutefocing hashes/checksums

With EthNet TX Tools, you can generate valid Ether, Token, or Contract transactions of any amount/type that is allowed by the specific token/program/application. EtherNet TX Tools works by bruteforcing for the correct transaction's hash/checksum, until a valid transaction is found with the specific options chosen in EtherNet TX Tools. (certain transactions take more bruteforce attempts than others, thus the "Estimated time" shown during the brutefocing process.

After successfully bruteforcing/generating a transaction, you can broadcast it to the Ethereum testnet or mainnet.

Along with the ability to send "fake" Ether, "fake" tokens, and broadcast "fake" contract transactions (very simple contracts as of version 0.1.3), EtherNet TX Tools is a great tool for helping developers, programmers, or anyone else that wants to understand more about the Ethereum network and how it works as a whole, but works as a connected system. Understanding its' Blockchain, Tokens, Contrants, and everything else you could want to "mess around" with Ethereum transactions.

***This is not a free money machine. Any ETH sent, Ethereum based tokens sent, or Ethereum contracts broadcasted will never 
receive confirmations.

#### Windows Binaries

If you want to test out the functions of EtherNet Transaction Tools, but can't/don't want to compile the source, you can just head over to the releases page and download the most current compiled binaries: https://github.com/gogandmog/ethnet/releases

*Special Thanks to johnny217 for his incredibly genius work on coding most of the bruteforcing process to be literally over 100 times faster than the original implementation.
